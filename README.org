#+title: DMSCRIPTS


* ABOUT
Here I store all my run menu scripts. You can use these scripts with any launcher like dmenu, rofi
wofi etc. Per default it is configured to use wofi on wayland but if you are using xorg it will fallback to using rofi.
It will do this automatically. If you want to configure the behaviour of these script tou can mainly do that in dm-script.conf.
But at the moment not all scripts is using this config fully. But I will keep updating these scripts to make them better since I use
them everyday to speed up my workflow so they are very useful. You should give them a try if you haven't or write your own since it's
very easy.
